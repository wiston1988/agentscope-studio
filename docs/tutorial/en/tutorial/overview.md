# Overview

## _What is AgentScope-Studio?_

AgentScope-Studio is a visualization toolkit designed for developers working with the
[AgentScope library](https://github.com/agentscope-ai/agentscope).
It provides a **transparent**, **simple**, and **fun** way to develop, debug,
and evaluate agent-based applications.

## _Why AgentScope-Studio?_

AgentScope-Studio provides:

- Project management and chatbot-style visualization
- OpenTelemetry-based tracing visualization
- Evaluation-oriented analysis and visualization
- A built-in agent (AgentScope-Friday) for quick secondary development

## _How Does AgentScope-Studio Work?_

AgentScope-Studio is built with

- frontend: Typescript, React, Vite, TailwindCSS
- communication: TRPC over HTTP, websocket
- backend: Node.js, Express
- database: TypeORM with SQLite

> 💡 **Tip**: We are currently migrating the codebase to TailwindCSS.

AgentScope-Studio is released on the NPM registry as the package `@agentscope/studio` under the Apache-2.0 license.

## _How to Contribute?_

AgentScope-Studio is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from the community. Please refer to our
[contribution guide](./contributing) for more details on how to get involved.

## _By the Way_

While we may not be professionals in frontend and backend development, we are committed to building the most transparent,
simple, and fun user experience for developers using AgentScope.
Any suggestions and contributions are highly appreciated!
